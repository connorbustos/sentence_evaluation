2.2 #25,Determine the infinite limit: \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{2 - x}{(x - 1)^2}.,negative infinity,"To find the infinite limit of the function \frac{2 - x}{(x - 1)^2} as x approaches 1, we can simplify the expression by factoring the denominator and cancelling out the common factor:

\lim_{x \to 1} \frac{2 - x}{(x - 1)^2}
= \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{-(x - 2)}{(x - 1)^2}
= \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{-(x - 2)}{(x - 1)(x - 1)}
= \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{-1}{x - 1}
= -\infty

Therefore, the infinite limit of the function \frac{2 - x}{(x - 1)^2} as x approaches 1 is negative infinity (-∞)."
2.3 (#27),Determine the infinite limit: \lim_{x \to -3^+} \frac{x + 2}{x + 3},positive infinity,The infinite limit of (x + 2)/(x + 3) as x approaches -3 from the right is positive infinity (∞).
(2.3) #39,"Find the limit, if it exists. If the limit does not exist, explain why. \lim_{x \to 3} (2x + |x - 3|) ",6,"To find the limit of (2x + |x - 3|) as x approaches 3, let's consider the behavior of the function as x approaches 3 from the left and from the right.

When x approaches 3 from the left (x < 3), |x - 3| becomes -(x - 3) = 3 - x. So the function becomes 2x + (3 - x) = 3 + x. As x approaches 3 from the left, 3 + x approaches 6.

When x approaches 3 from the right (x > 3), |x - 3| becomes (x - 3). So the function becomes 2x + (x - 3) = 3x - 3. As x approaches 3 from the right, 3x - 3 approaches 6.

Since both the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit approach the same value, which is 6, the limit exists.

Therefore, the limit of (2x + |x - 3|) as x approaches 3 is 6."
(2.3) #23,"Evaluate the limit, if it exists: \lim_{x \to 7} \frac{\sqrt{x + 2} - 3}{x - 7}. When giving the answer, format your response by saying `The answer to (question) is (answer).` For the answer only, display in Non Latex.",1/6,"To evaluate the limit of (sqrt(x + 2) - 3)/(x - 7) as x approaches 7, let's first try direct substitution:

(sqrt(7 + 2) - 3)/(7 - 7) = (sqrt(9) - 3)/0

Here, we get an indeterminate form of (0/0). To resolve this, let's rationalize the numerator:

(sqrt(x + 2) - 3)/(x - 7) * ((sqrt(x + 2) + 3)/(sqrt(x + 2) + 3)) = ((x + 2) - 9)/(x - 7)(sqrt(x + 2) + 3)

= (x - 7)/(x - 7)(sqrt(x + 2) + 3)

Now, as x approaches 7, the denominator approaches 0, but the numerator does not. So, we can cancel out (x - 7) from the numerator and denominator:

1/(sqrt(x + 2) + 3)

Now, we can directly substitute x = 7:

1/(sqrt(7 + 2) + 3) = 1/(sqrt(9) + 3) = 1/(3 + 3) = 1/6

Therefore, the limit of (sqrt(x + 2) - 3)/(x - 7) as x approaches 7 is 1/6."
(2.5) #31 ,Use continuity to evaluate the limit. \lim_{x \to 4} \frac{5 + \sqrt{x}}{\sqrt{5 + x}},7/3,"To evaluate the limit of (5 + sqrt(x))/(sqrt(5 + x)) as x approaches 4 using continuity, we'll check if the function is continuous at x = 4. If it is, we can directly substitute x = 4 to find the limit.

Both the numerator and the denominator involve square roots, and square roots are continuous functions for non-negative values. Therefore, the function (5 + sqrt(x))/(sqrt(5 + x)) is continuous everywhere where its denominator is non-zero, including at x = 4.

Now, let's substitute x = 4 into the function:

(5 + sqrt(4))/(sqrt(5 + 4)) = (5 + 2)/(sqrt(9)) = 7/3

Therefore, the limit of (5 + sqrt(x))/(sqrt(5 + x)) as x approaches 4 is 7/3."
(2.5) #33,Use continuity to evaluate the limit.  \lim_{x \to 1} e^{x^2 - x},1,"To evaluate the limit of e^(x^2 - x) as x approaches 1 using continuity, we'll check if the function e^(x^2 - x) is continuous at x = 1. 

The function e^(x^2 - x) is a composition of continuous functions: the exponential function e^u, where u = x^2 - x, and the polynomial function u = x^2 - x. Both exponential functions and polynomial functions are continuous everywhere.

Since the composition of continuous functions is also continuous, e^(x^2 - x) is continuous everywhere, including at x = 1.

Now, let's substitute x = 1 into the function:

e^(1^2 - 1) = e^(1 - 1) = e^0 = 1

Therefore, the limit of e^(x^2 - x) as x approaches 1 is 1."
(2.6) #21,Find the limit. \lim_{u \to \infty} \frac{4u^4 + 5}{(u^2 - 2)(2u^2 - 1)} ,2,"For the limit of (4u^4 + 5)/((u^2 - 2)(2u^2 - 1)) as u approaches infinity, we can use the principle of continuity. At infinity, the dominant term in the numerator and denominator will determine the behavior of the function.

As u approaches infinity, the terms with the highest power in the numerator and denominator dominate the function. In this case, it's the term u^4 in the numerator and 2u^4 in the denominator.

So, we can rewrite the expression as:

lim_{u → ∞} (4u^4 + 5)/((u^2 - 2)(2u^2 - 1)) = lim_{u → ∞} (4 + 5/u^4)/((1 - 2/u^2)(2 - 1/u^2))

As u approaches infinity, 5/u^4 and all other terms with u^(-n) (where n is a positive integer) approach 0. So, the expression becomes:

(4 + 0)/((1 - 0)(2 - 0)) = 4/(1*2) = 2

Therefore, the limit of (4u^4 + 5)/((u^2 - 2)(2u^2 - 1)) as u approaches infinity is 2."
