Calling GPT for case 3 with question: Find the limit, if it exists. If the limit does not exist, explain why. \lim_{x \to 3} (2x + |x - 3|) 
GPT Successfully Answered with The answer to \lim_{x \to 3} (2x + |x - 3|) is 9. 

To solve this, we can break down the absolute value function. When x is less than 3, |x - 3| simplifies to -(x - 3), and when x is greater than 3, |x - 3| simplifies to (x - 3). 

1. When x < 3: 
plug in the value of -(x - 3) into the limit function. We then get: 
2x + -(x - 3) 
= 2x - x + 3 
= x + 3 

Taking the limit as x approaches 3 from the left side, we get: 
3 + 3 = 6 

2. When x > 3: 
plug in the value of (x - 3) into the limit function, we get: 
2x + (x - 3) 
= 2x + x - 3 
= 3x - 3 

Taking the limit as x approaches 3 from the right side, we get: 
3*3 - 3 = 6 

Since the limit from both sides is the same, the limit of the function \lim_{x \to 3} (2x + |x - 3|) is equal to 6 + 3 = 9.

Calling GPT for case 5 with question: Use continuity to evaluate the limit. \lim_{x \to 4} \frac{5 + \sqrt{x}}{\sqrt{5 + x}}
GPT Successfully Answered with To evaluate the limit using continuity, we need to simplify the expression first:

\lim_{x \to 4} \frac{5 + \sqrt{x}}{\sqrt{5 + x}}.

Plugging in x = 4, the expression becomes:

\frac{5 + \sqrt{4}}{\sqrt{5 + 4}} = \frac{5 + 2}{\sqrt{9}} = \frac{7}{3}.

Therefore, the answer to the limit is 7/3.

Calling GPT for case 6 with question: Use continuity to evaluate the limit.  \lim_{x \to 1} e^{x^2 - x}
GPT Successfully Answered with To evaluate the limit of  \lim_{x \to 1} e^{x^2 - x}, we can rewrite the function as e^{x(x-1)} and notice that it is a composition of continuous functions, e^x being continuous everywhere and x(x-1) being continuous at x=1.

Therefore, we can directly substitute x=1 into the function e^{x(x-1)} to find that the answer to \lim_{x \to 1} e^{x^2 - x} is e^0 = 1.
