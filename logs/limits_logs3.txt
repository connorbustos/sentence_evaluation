Calling GPT for case 5 with question: Use continuity to evaluate the limit. \lim_{x \to 4} \frac{5 + \sqrt{x}}{\sqrt{5 + x}}
GPT Successfully Answered with To evaluate the limit, we can see that both the numerator and denominator approach zero as x approaches 4. We can rewrite the expression by rationalizing the denominator to get \frac{5 + \sqrt{x}}{\sqrt{5 + x}} * \frac{\sqrt{5 + x}}{\sqrt{5 + x}} = \frac{5\sqrt{5 + x} + x}{5 + x}. Now, we can substitute x = 4 into the expression to get (5\sqrt{9} + 4)/(9) = (5*3 + 4)/9 = (15 + 4)/9 = 19/9. 

Therefore, the answer to the limit \lim_{x \to 4} \frac{5 + \sqrt{x}}{\sqrt{5 + x}} is 19/9.
Case 5: FAIL

Method and Approach: To evaluate the limit, we can see that both the numerator and denominator approach zero as x approaches 4. We can rewrite the expression by rationalizing the denominator to get \frac{5 + \sqrt{x}}{\sqrt{5 + x}} * \frac{\sqrt{5 + x}}{\sqrt{5 + x}} = \frac{5\sqrt{5 + x} + x}{5 + x}. Now, we can substitute x = 4 into the expression to get (5\sqrt{9} + 4)/(9) = (5*3 + 4)/9 = (15 + 4)/9 = 19/9.

Calling GPT for case 6 with question: Use continuity to evaluate the limit.  \lim_{x \to 1} e^{x^2 - x}
GPT Successfully Answered with To evaluate the limit, we first notice that the function $e^{x^2 - x}$ is continuous for all values of $x$. Therefore, we can simply substitute $x = 1$ into the function to find the limit.

So, the answer to \lim_{x \to 1} e^{x^2 - x} is e^0, or 1.
