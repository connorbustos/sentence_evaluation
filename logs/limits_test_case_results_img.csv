In this case, the leading term in the numerator is \(-x^2\) and in the denominator it is \(2x^2\). By dividing the numerator and the denominator by \(x^2\), we obtain:

\[\lim_{x \to -\infty} \frac{1/x^2 - 1/x - 1}{2 - 7/x^2}\]

As x approaches negative infinity, the terms \(1/x^2\) and \(1/x\) in the numerator and \(7/x^2\) in the denominator approach zero. Thus, the limit can be simplified to:

\[\lim_{x \to -\infty} \frac{-1}{2}\]

Therefore, the limit simplifies to \(-1/2\). The answer to the limit of the expression as x approaches negative infinity is \(-1/2\).",\(-1/2\).,-1/2,"tensor([[0.8103]], device='mps:0')",PASS

\[
\lim_{{u \to \infty}} \frac{4u^4 + 5}{(u^2 - 2)(2u^2 - 1)},
\]

we apply the concept of polynomial limits at infinity. The leading term in the numerator is \(4u^4\), and the leading terms in the denominator when multiplied out will give \(2u^4\) as the highest degree term. We can therefore simplify the limit by dividing all terms by \(u^4\), the highest power of \(u\) in the expression.

After dividing by \(u^4\), the limit becomes

\[
\lim_{{u \to \infty}} \frac{4 + 5/u^4}{(1 - 2/u^2)(2 - 1/u^2)}.
\]

As \(u \to \infty\), \(5/u^4 \to 0\), \(2/u^2 \to 0\), and \(1/u^2 \to 0\). Hence, the limit simplifies to

\[
\lim_{{u \to \infty}} \frac{4}{(1)(2)} = \frac{4}{2} = 2.

By dividing both terms in the numerator \(\sqrt{9x^6 - x}\) by \(x^3\) and simplifying within the square root, it becomes \(\sqrt{(\frac{9x^6}{x^6}) - (\frac{x}{x^6})} = \sqrt{9 - \frac{1}{x^5}}\).

In the denominator, \(x^3 + 1\), when we divide \(x^3\) by \(x^3\) we get 1, and \(1/x^3\) tends to 0 as x tends to infinity.

So as x approaches infinity, the original expression simplifies to:

\[\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\sqrt{9x^6 - x}}{x^3 + 1} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\sqrt{9 - \frac{1}{x^5}}}{1 + \frac{1}{x^3}}\]

Now we can directly substitute infinity into the limits to find that \(\sqrt{9 - \frac{1}{x^5}}\) tends to \(\sqrt{9}\) which is 3 and \(1 + \frac{1}{x^3}\) tends to 1.

Therefore, the answer to the limit is 3/1 which simplifies to 3.

The expression is:

\[
\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x + x^3 + x^5}{1 - x^2 + x^4}
\]

We can divide each term in the numerator and the denominator by \( x^5 \) (the highest power of \( x \) in the numerator) to simplify the limit:

\[
\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\frac{x}{x^5} + \frac{x^3}{x^5} + \frac{x^5}{x^5}}{\frac{1}{x^5} - \frac{x^2}{x^5} + \frac{x^4}{x^5}}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\frac{1}{x^4} + \frac{1}{x^2} + 1}{\frac{1}{x^5} - \frac{1}{x^3} + \frac{1}{x}}
\]

As \( x \) approaches infinity, \( \frac{1}{x^n} \) (for any positive integer \( n \)) approaches 0. So the previous expression simplifies to:

\[
\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{0 + 0 + 1}{0 - 0 + 0}
\]

Hence, the limit simplifies to:

\[
\lim_{x \to \infty} 1
