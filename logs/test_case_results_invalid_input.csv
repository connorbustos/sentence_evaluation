Determine the infinite limit: \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{2 - x}{(x - 1)^0},The answer to the infinite limit: \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{2 - x}{(x - 1)^0} is -1.,-1.,Error due to division by zero,"tensor([[0.2533]], device='mps:0')",FAIL
Determine the infinite limit: \lim_{x \to -3^+} \frac{x + 2}{x - 3},The answer to the infinite limit: lim_{x \to -3^+} \frac{x + 2}{x - 3} is -\infty.,-\infty.,Limit does not exist due,"tensor([[0.2121]], device='mps:0')",FAIL
"Find the limit, if it exists. If the limit does not exist, explain why. \lim_{x \to 3} (2x + |x - laptop|)",The answer to the limit \lim_{x \to 3} (2x + |x - laptop|) is 5.,5.,Invalid as 'laptop' is not a numerical value,"tensor([[0.0929]], device='mps:0')",FAIL
"Evaluate the limit, if it exists: \frac{\sqrt{x + 2} - 3}{x - 7}","To evaluate the limit of the expression \frac{\sqrt{x + 2} - 3}{x - 7}, we can try direct substitution:

\lim_{{x \to 7}} \frac{\sqrt{x + 2} - 3}{x - 7} 

= \frac{\sqrt{7 + 2} - 3}{7 - 7} 

= \frac{\sqrt{9} - 3}{0} 

= \frac{3 - 3}{0}

= \frac{0}{0}

Since we got an indeterminate form of \frac{0}{0}, we can simplify the expression further using L'Hopital's Rule:

\lim_{{x \to 7}} \frac{\sqrt{x + 2} - 3}{x - 7} = \lim_{{x \to 7}} \frac{\frac{1}{2\sqrt{x + 2}}}{1}

Now, substituting x = 7:

\frac{\frac{1}{2\sqrt{9}}}{1} = \frac{\frac{1}{2 * 3}}{1} = \frac{\frac{1}{6}}{1} = \frac{1}{6}

Therefore, the answer to the expression \frac{\sqrt{x + 2} - 3}{x - 7} as x approaches 7 is 1/6.",1/6.,Invalid as the limit condition is missing.,"tensor([[0.2080]], device='mps:0')",FAIL
